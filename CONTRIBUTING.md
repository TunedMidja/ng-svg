# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this collection of Angular svgs. 

This project aims to provide a collection of interactive and reusable svg components as a reference for anyone trying to integrate svgs into their angular applications. Please keep this goal in mind when contributing to the project. As a reference, code should be commented when necessary so that others may quickly understand the purpose.

## Getting Started

Clone the project, cd into the folder, and run the command `npm install` to grab dependancies.

Run `ng serve` for a development server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/ to see your local version of the app, which will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Adding a new component

So you want to add a new component? That's great! New components should ideally demonstrate some useful technique or functionality, and include some sort of interactivity (for instance, the underlying data comes from a service, or is adjustable by the user)

Please remember to file a new issue describing your component, and create a branch with a meaningful name to work off of.

New components can be generated by the angular cli using the command `ng g component your_component_name`

Once you are satisfied with your contribution, please open a pull request with a clear description and reference to the issue number.
